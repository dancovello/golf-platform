# Decisions log

Decisions made after doc 04, with the reason for each. Newest first. Doc 04 still wins on anything not covered here.

## 2026-10-10 — First planning session

### Account types (super-admin vs club editor)
Payload's admin panel can only log people in from **one** user collection. So the two account types share one login collection, but are kept structurally separate by these rules. All of them are required:

1. **The database enforces the account type.** A super-admin has no club. A club editor has exactly one club. A record that breaks either rule cannot be saved.
2. **A club editor can never change their own account type or club**, through the admin screens or the API.
3. **Super-admins are created only by a command-line script.** There is no sign-up or admin-screen route to create one. The script never stores credentials in the repo. It needs Dan's explicit approval before it is ever run against production.
4. **Super-admins must use two-factor authentication.**
5. **The tenant-isolation tests include escalation attempts.** An editor trying to become a super-admin, or to reach another club, must fail. If such an attempt succeeds, the build fails.
6. **This design must be checked before launch** by the devops contact and by the independent security review.

### Club editors
- A club can have several editors. In v1 they all have the same permissions.
- Only the super-admin invites editors.

### Per-club "globals"
Site Settings, Navigation and Booking Integration are described as "globals" in docs 02, 04 and 08. In Payload, a global has a single copy for the whole app, so each one is built as a tenant-owned collection with exactly one record per club. Never build these as real Payload globals, because that would share one club's settings with every club.

### Tenancy approach
Use Payload's official multi-tenant plugin, hardened so that editors cannot discover other clubs. Every collection still defines its own explicit access rules. A short spike at the start of step 2 confirms the plugin against the isolation tests. If it can't close a leak, we stop and explain before switching to hand-rolled access control.

### Repository and CI
- The repo is **private**, on GitHub Pro.
- Classic branch protection is used rather than rulesets, because rulesets on private repos need GitHub Team.
- GitHub's own secret scanning is a paid add-on on private repos, so CI uses **gitleaks**, which is free. Dependency scanning uses `pnpm audit`, OSV-Scanner and Dependabot alerts.

### Environments
- **Staging only for now.** Production (the Vercel production environment and the Neon production project) is not created until step 3, once backups and a restore have been proven.
- Staging is a Vercel custom environment (Pro includes one) tracking `main`. It uses a Neon project in London (`aws-eu-west-2`).
- Vercel's production branch is set to `production`, which won't exist until step 3. Vercel always makes a new project's first deployment a "production" one. That deployment has no database or secrets.
- No platform name or domain yet, so staging uses a placeholder `*.vercel.app` address.
- Production releases (from step 3 onwards) happen only when Dan merges a release PR from `main` into `production`.

## 2026-10-11 — Step 2 decisions (after the 2.1 spike)

- **Two-factor login is required for every account**, super-admins and editors alike. It uses a free, open-source option, with no paid service. The recommended choice is `payload-totp`, with two-factor secrets encrypted at rest; the final pick goes past the devops contact.
- **No backup codes in v1.** A lost phone is handled by the super-admin resetting that editor's two-factor. A super-admin's own reset is done from the command line, and needs Dan's approval on production.
- **Editor invites:** the super-admin copies a one-time "set your password" link and sends it to the editor, until an email provider is chosen.
- **Document locking is off** (no "X is editing this page" warning). Payload's lock records are readable by every logged-in user across clubs, and their access rules can't be changed. A test fails if locking comes back.
- **Every record gets a random ID (UUID v4)**, never a counting number, so IDs don't reveal how many clubs or records exist.
- **Account creation rules:**
  - Editors are created by a super-admin in the admin screens, or by a trusted script.
  - Super-admins are created only by `pnpm create-super-admin`.
  - Payload's "create first user" screen is replaced with an explanation page.

## 2026-10-11 — Devops review of step 2

Dan's devops contact checked and approved the review items raised in PRs #18, #23 and #25:

- **Account types:**
  - database-enforced account type and club, set once and never changeable;
  - super-admins created only by script;
  - editors only by a super-admin.
- **Two-factor login:**
  - `payload-totp`, required for everyone;
  - secrets encrypted at rest with `TOTP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, kept in Vercel and the password manager;
  - the plugin has a single maintainer, so its version is pinned and each update is reviewed.
- **Known limitations, accepted for now:**
  - a code can be reused within its 30-second window (the plugin has no replay protection);
  - two simultaneous logins to one account can overwrite each other's session (Payload behaviour);
  - the plugin's code boxes have no screen-reader labels (accessibility follow-up);
  - the "Reset Password" wording on invite links (follow-up).
- **Invites:** one-time set-your-password links, valid for 72 hours. Public "Forgot password?" is off until an email provider is chosen.

**Still open (actions, not covered by this approval):**
- **A less-powerful database account for the app**, instead of `neondb_owner`. Due in build step 3, before production exists.
- **An independent security review / penetration test before launch** (doc 04 §7). Dan's condition on the account design also requires it. A devops review isn't a substitute.

## 2026-10-11 — Neon plan

- Neon **stays on the free plan** until the first club's data (step 4). Production is empty until then.
- **Step 4 can't start onboarding a club until** Neon is upgraded to Launch, production has 7-day history, daily snapshots and branch protection, and the Neon parts of the restore drill have been rerun.

## 2026-10-11 — Photo and video storage (step 5.1b)

- **Cloudflare R2, one bucket per environment:** `golf-platform-media-staging` (staging and pull-request previews) and `golf-platform-media-production`. Location hint Western Europe. Not the EU jurisdiction used for backups: these are public website images, not personal data, and Cloudflare doesn't document the public address for jurisdiction buckets.
- **Public files on a separate domain** (doc 04 §8). Until step 4 brings a domain, that's each bucket's `r2.dev` address, which Cloudflare intends for non-production traffic. **Step 4 must move production to a custom domain** (e.g. `media.<platform domain>`) behind Cloudflare.
- **Unguessable, never listed:** each file sits in its own random folder, and every file name starts with a random code. The code also stops Payload renaming club A's `hero.jpg` to `hero-1.jpg` because club B has one, which would hint that another club exists. Visitors can't list the bucket or the Media collection.
- **Uploads go straight from the browser to R2** (Vercel refuses request bodies over 4.5 MB), using a 10-minute signed link that can't overwrite an existing file. Links are only issued for the allowed types (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, MP4, WebM; no SVG; 50 MB), and the file is stored and served as that type (`src/media/uploadGuards.ts`; Payload itself doesn't check its own list at this step). Payload then downloads the file once and checks its real contents, refusing the record if they don't match.
- **Local development and tests** use SeaweedFS (`docker-compose.yml`), never real R2.
- **Known gap:** a file that fails Payload's content check after a browser upload stays in the bucket, unlisted and served only as an allowed image or video type. A response header telling browsers not to second-guess the type (`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`) needs the custom domain in step 4. A clean-up job is a follow-up (Payload Jobs Queue).

## 2026-10-15 — GitHub Actions minutes

- The repo used all 3,000 monthly GitHub Actions minutes (GitHub Pro). Dan **won't pay for more**, and decided against running checks on his own Mac and against making the repo public.
- Over the previous 30 days, CI used about 2,660 of those minutes, at about 14 minutes a run. Each of its ~10 jobs was billed in whole minutes and installed everything from scratch, and about 800 minutes came from CI running again after each merge into `main`.
- **CI is now three jobs:** `quick-checks` (typecheck, lint, formatting, secret scan, dependency scan, migration guard), `tests` (every Vitest test, including the tenant-isolation suite) and `browser-checks` (the build, the picture check, and the admin-screen tenant-isolation tests). The checks themselves are unchanged. These three are the required checks on `main`.
- **No CI run after merging into `main`.** Branch protection makes every pull request catch up with `main` first, so its own run already checked exactly what lands.
- **Changes that can't affect anything skip the heavy jobs.** A change to only docs, Claude notes or Markdown skips `tests` and `browser-checks`, and the picture check is skipped when nothing the pictures depend on changed. GitHub counts a skipped required check as passed. `quick-checks` always runs, so the secret scan sees every change.
- **Claude runs the checks locally and pushes a branch once it's ready**, not after every small fix, because every push re-runs CI.
